Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, there is a significant rise in health-related problems, particularly among the younger population. The primary causes include poor dietary habits, irregular sleep cycles, mental stress, and lack of physical activity. Managing daily health and overall well-being has become a challenge. In extreme circumstances such as wars, natural disasters, or pandemics, these issues are amplified, leaving common people and patients vulnerable without access to proper care or monitoring. There is a strong need for a sustainable, smart health solution that can assist people in maintaining their health, even during crises.
