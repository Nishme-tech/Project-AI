# Patient health recommdeation system 

Healthy Vibes
This project introduces a smart Patient Health Recommendation System that offers personalized health and lifestyle advice based on user data, medical history, and real-time metrics [Electronic Health Record - EHR]. Integrating AI and wearable tech, it supports disease prevention, early detection, and proactive care. It enables doctor-patient communication, provides health alerts, reminders, and dashboards, while ensuring data privacy and security. Healthy VIbes 24/7 is a personalized AI-driven healthcare solution aimed at providing real-time health monitoring and nutrition recommendations for individuals dealing with chronic illnesses like cancer and diabetes.

Problem Statement
In today’s fast-paced world, there is a significant rise in health-related problems, particularly among the younger population. The primary causes include poor dietary habits, irregular sleep cycles, mental stress, and lack of physical activity. Managing daily health and overall well-being has become a challenge. In extreme circumstances such as wars, natural disasters, or pandemics, these issues are amplified, leaving common people and patients vulnerable without access to proper care or monitoring. There is a strong need for a sustainable, smart health solution that can assist people in maintaining their health, even during crises.


Python Libaries 

1. ehrdata
  A foundational data structure for storing and accessing EHR datasets.
Designed for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles. Often used alongside EHrapy for deeper analysis.

2. FHIRClient
   Python client for interacting with FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) servers.
Useful for building apps that connect to hospital systems or public health APIs. Supports authentication, resource queries, and data parsing.

3. PyHealthcare
   A toolkit for healthcare data analysis, including EHRs.
Offers utilities for patient clustering, risk prediction, and time-series modeling.

4. GNU Health (Python-based)
  A full health information system with EMR, lab, and patient modules.
Built with Python and PostgreSQL. Ideal for community clinics or low-resource settings.

5. Othes Tools for Data Science in Healthcare
pandas: For tabular data manipulation.
scikit-learn: For predictive modeling.
lifelines: For survival analysis.
tsfresh: For time-series feature extraction—great for patient monitoring data.



CREATING a Blockchain for Secure Medical Records 
Decentralized data management in healthcare refers to the storage and handling of medical records across a network of distributed nodes. Instead of a single entity holding control, data is spread out, enhancing accessibility and security.



Our goal is to create a gold standard EHR that supports:
-> Clinical Excellence: By enabling instant access to a patient’s complete medical history, diagnostics, treatments, and outcomes.
-> Interoperability: Through adoption of internationally recognized data standards (e.g., HL7 FHIR, SNOMED CT, LOINC).
-> Patient-Centered Care: Empowering patients with control over their health data and facilitating shared decision-making.

This initiative will require collaboration across clinical experts, software engineers, policymakers, and patient advocates worldwide. By uniting these stakeholders, we can create a system that not only meets the highest clinical standards but also adapts dynamically to emerging healthcare innovations.
